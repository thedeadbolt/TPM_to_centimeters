This calculator serves the purpose of facilitating the tedious calculations that involve converting TPM into pixel/ centimeter formats.
This project's main purpose is to facilitate work I've encountered when making gene expression images for research papers, where one must convert TPM into a visual format that can be easily understood.
Future updates may include:
- Django framework;
- Importing files directly for multiple value conversion at the same time;
